# Serenity Relaxing Drink Launch Website

Welcome to the Serenity Drink Launch Website repository! This project is a single-page website designed to communicate the launch of a new product, the relaxing drink, under the brand Serenity. The website will showcase the product, provide information about its benefits, and create excitement around the launch.

## Tech Stack

For this project, we have chosen the following tech stack:

- Typescript: A statically-typed superset of JavaScript, which adds strong typing and enhances code quality and maintainability.
- Next.js: A popular React framework that offers server-side rendering, optimized performance, and easy routing for creating fast and SEO-friendly single-page applications.
- SCSS: A powerful and feature-rich CSS preprocessor that enables modular and maintainable styling.
- Hygraph: A headless Content Management System (CMS) that allows us to easily manage and update the website's content without changing the codebase.

## Project Management

We will follow an Agile project management approach to ensure efficient development and timely delivery of the website. We will organize the project into the following phases:

1. **Planning**: Understanding the requirements, defining project scope, and setting up development environment.

2. **Design**: Creating scss variables, aligning with the Serenity brand book, mock up rough idea.

3. **Development**: Implementing the website using the chosen tech stack, integrating with Hygraph for content management, and adding smooth animations and interactions.

4. **Testing**: Conducting tests and cross-browser testing to ensure the website functions correctly on different devices.

5. **Deployment**: Deploying the website to Vercel, ensuring it is accessible to users globally.
